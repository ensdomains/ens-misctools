# ENS Misc Tools

Miscellaneous tasks to address some edge-cases that may not make sense for the ENS Manager App (or are still on the roadmap)

* [Check a name](https://tools.ens.domains/check)
  * Quick dashboard for normalization, expiry, parent expiry, resolver, wrapped state, and subnames
* [Set Primary Name](https://tools.ens.domains/setprimary)
  * Works for contract addresses too
* [Unwrap a name](https://tools.ens.domains/unwrap)
