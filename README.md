# ENS Misc Tools

Miscellaneous tasks to address some edge-cases that may not make sense for the ENS Manager App (or are still on the roadmap)

* [Check a name](https://tools.ens.domains/check)
  * Quick dashboard for normalization, expiry, parent expiry, resolver, wrapped state, and subnames
* [Set Primary Name](https://tools.ens.domains/setprimary)
  * Works for contract addresses too
* [Unwrap a name](https://tools.ens.domains/unwrap)
  * Works for any wrapped name (.eth/DNS/subnames) as long as it isn't Locked
* [Set Public Resolver Manager](https://tools.ens.domains/setprmanager)
  * Approve a separate account that can edit records for wrapped names
* [Set Records](https://tools.ens.domains/setrecords)
  * Basic page to set ETH address and text records. Only needed temporarily until the official UI supports public resolver managers
